## Games

| Game | Year | Description | Play |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| [Computer Space](computer-space/) | 1971 | The Nutting Associates original. The first commercially sold coin-operated video game. Newtonian physics with discrete 16-direction rotation, guided missiles, two AI saucers, time-based rounds, and monochrome CRT visuals with phosphor glow and scanlines. | Open `computer-space/index.html` |
| [Pong](pong/) | 1972 | The Atari original. The first commercially successful video game. Authentic 8-segment paddle deflection, progressive ball acceleration, monochrome CRT visuals with scanline effects, and square wave audio matching the original hardware tones. | Open `pong/index.html` |
| [Gun Fight](gun-fight/) | 1975 | The Midway classic. The first arcade game to use a microprocessor. Two cowboys duel in a western shootout around destructible obstacles. 7-position gun arm aiming, bullet ricochets, destructible cacti and pine trees, moving stagecoach, and AI opponent. | Open `gun-fight/index.html` |
| [Breakout](breakout/) | 1976 | The Atari classic. Smash through 8 rows of colored bricks with a bouncing ball and paddle. Cellophane color overlay, 4-level ball speed progression, paddle shrink after back-wall breakthrough, and authentic scoring (1/3/5/7 points per row pair). | Open `breakout/index.html` |
| [Space Invaders](space-invaders/) | 1978 | The Taito classic. Defend Earth from descending alien formations with your laser cannon. Pixel-accurate sprites, destructible shields with pixel-level erosion, cellophane color overlay, and attract screen gag animations from the original ROM. | Open `space-invaders/index.html` |
| [Galaxian](galaxian/) | 1979 | The Namco classic. The first arcade game with true RGB color. Dive-bombing aliens with bezier-curve attack paths, flagship convoy mechanics with escort bonuses, and a scrolling starfield. | Open `galaxian/index.html` |
| [Asteroids](asteroids/) | 1979 | The Atari classic. Pilot your ship through an asteroid field, blast rocks into fragments, and dodge UFOs. Vector-style graphics with phosphor glow effects, inertial physics, and hyperspace. | Open `asteroids/index.html` |
| [Lunar Lander](lunar-lander/) | 1979 | The Atari classic. Guide your lunar module to a safe landing on the moon's surface. Altitude-dependent zoom, procedural terrain with scoring pads, fuel management, four difficulty missions, and vector phosphor glow. | Open `lunar-lander/index.html` |
| [Pac-Man](pac-man/) | 1980 | The Namco icon. Navigate the maze, eat all the dots, and avoid the ghosts. Power pellets turn the tables, letting you chase down frightened ghosts for bonus points. Direction buffering, scatter/chase AI, combo scoring, and the iconic wakka-wakka sound. | Open `pac-man/index.html` |
| [Centipede](centipede/) | 1980 | The Atari classic. Blast the centipede as it winds through a mushroom field. Tile-based mechanics with centipede splitting, poisoned mushrooms, spider proximity scoring, and the original 12-wave cycle. | Open `centipede/index.html` |
| [Missile Command](missile-command/) | 1980 | The Atari classic. Defend six cities from nuclear missiles using three anti-missile batteries. Mouse aiming with 3-key silo firing, persistent missile trails, octagonal explosions, bombers dropping mines, satellites, 10 wave-cycling color schemes, mountainous terrain, and progressive difficulty with 30 interceptors per wave. | Open `missile-command/index.html` |
| [Defender](defender/) | 1981 | The Williams classic. Defend humanoids from alien abduction across a horizontally scrolling landscape. Multiple enemy types, smart bombs, hyperspace, and a minimap scanner. | Open `defender/index.html` |

## Design Philosophy

Each game follows the same conventions:

- **Single-file architecture** — all game logic lives in one `game.js` file, organized into clearly named sections (CONFIG, Math Utilities, Sprite/Shape Data, Sound Engine, Input Handler, Entity Classes, Collision System, Renderer, Game State Machine, Main Loop)
- **Zero dependencies** — vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Web Audio API only
- **3-file structure** — `index.html` (shell), `style.css` (layout), `game.js` (everything else)
- **Authentic recreation** — faithful to the original hardware behavior, scoring systems, and visual style rather than "inspired by" reinterpretations
- **Procedural audio** — all sound effects synthesized at runtime via Web Audio API oscillators and noise buffers; no audio files
- **Fixed 60Hz timestep** — accumulator-pattern game loop with delta clamping for consistent physics regardless of display refresh rate

## How to Run

Clone the repo and open any game's `index.html` in a browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliensimon/browser-games.git
open browser-games/space-invaders/index.html
```

No server required — everything runs client-side.
